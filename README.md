### Description

Are you tired of VB's inaccurate timer control? Well here is the code for you! This code demonstrates how to use High Resolution Multimedia Timers. With 2 simple API calls you can have a timer that can actually fire 1000 times in a single second instead of VB's timer which can only fire between 50 and 100 times per second. Thanks go out to www.allapi.net, I learned most of what I know about Multimedia Timers from there. If you vote, please leave a comment explaining your vote whether it is a good or bad vote. If you have any improvements or suggestions, please let me know so that I can update it.
